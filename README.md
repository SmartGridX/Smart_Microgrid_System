# ⚡ Microgrid Monitoring System

A real-time IoT-based microgrid monitoring system that collects field data from sensors, stores it in the cloud, and provides an interactive dashboard and mobile app for monitoring energy usage, generation, and system health.


## 📌 Project Overview
The **Renewable Energy Monitoring (REM)** system is designed to track, analyze, and visualize energy generation and consumption from renewable sources.  

It connects IoT devices, such as sensors and meters, to a central backend system, allowing users to:

- Monitor **real-time energy production and consumption**  
- Access **historical data** for analysis  
- Receive **alerts for faults or abnormal behavior**  
- Gain **insights through analytics** for better energy management  

This project helps promote **efficient energy usage**, **early detection of issues**, and **data-driven decision-making** for sustainable energy solutions.
